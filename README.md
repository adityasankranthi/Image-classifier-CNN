This project involves developing and fine-tuning Convolutional Neural Networks (CNNs) to classify images of monkey species. The project is divided into three main tasks:

Custom CNN Architectures: Designed and trained two different CNN architectures to classify monkey species, experimenting with various configurations such as different layers, filter sizes, and dropout rates. The performance of each model was evaluated on a test dataset, with a comparison of accuracy and confusion matrices.

Fine-Tuning a Pre-Trained Model: A pre-trained CNN architecture was fine-tuned by adding custom layers to adapt the model for monkey species classification. The fine-tuned model's performance was then compared against the custom CNN models, with a focus on improving accuracy and reducing errors.

Error Analysis: Analyzed misclassified test images from the best-performing model to identify patterns in the errors. This analysis included a qualitative assessment of why the model made incorrect predictions and whether the fine-tuned model showed improvement on these challenging cases.

The project demonstrates practical applications of CNNs in image classification, along with techniques for model fine-tuning and error analysis, and provides insights into the challenges and solutions in deploying CNNs for real-world classification tasks.
